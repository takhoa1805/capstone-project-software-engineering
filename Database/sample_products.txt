Introduction to Algorithms

200000

1

This book is often said to be the bible for Algorithms.

The book is famous by the name of CLRS Book on Algorithms. However, this book is not that beginner-friendly. So, if you are a complete beginner to the world of data structures and algorithms, this book might not be the right one for you but it is a really good book for your future read. The book is highly recommended even in Colleges and Universities. This is surely one of the best books for Algorithms. Recommendation: This book should be read after one has a good hold over basic data structures like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues and when one has a fair idea (beginner level only) about algorithms.
